### Task: 
Responsive duplication of the 2018 Instagram Homepage
### Take aways:
I learned the importance of starting from big picture to small. At first, I had tried going section by section and was left wit heaps of disconnected and horribly malfunctioning code. 
For example: I'd go into the particulars of the scroll effects of the posts before I had the side bar even constructed.
After taking a day off to grieve the project, I started from scratch, planning and connecting sections and ensuring they work together before going into the details of each section.
I discovered the beauty of using css to debug by colouring sections and seeing if empty divs are where you expect them to be.

### What I'd do differently:
The other accounts section could definately be improved. As well as the icon sizing, that could be more responsive overall than its current static positon. 
Additionally, the overall sizing of the posts themselves while proportional still feels a tad too big and in-your-face.
